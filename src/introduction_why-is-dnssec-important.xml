 <title>Why is DNSSEC Important? (Why Should I Care?)</title>
 <para>You might be thinking to yourself: all this DNSSEC stuff sounds
 wonderful, but why should I care? Below are some reasons why you may want to
 consider deploying DNSSEC:

  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
    <simpara><emphasis>Be a good netizen</emphasis>: By enabling DNSSEC
    validation (as described in <xref linkend="dnssec-validation" />) on your
    DNS servers, you're protecting your users or yourself a little more by
    checking answers returned to you; by signing your zones (as described in
    <xref linkend="dnssec-signing" />), you are making it possible for other
    people to verify your zone data. As more people adopt DNSSEC, the Internet
    as a whole becomes more secure for everyone.</simpara>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <simpara><emphasis>Compliance</emphasis>: You may not even get a say
    whether or not you want to implement DNSSEC, if your organization is
    subject to compliance standards that mandate it. For example, the US
    government set a deadline back in 2008, to have all <code>.gov</code> sub
    domains signed by the December 2009 <footnote><para>The Office of
    Management and Budget (OMB) for the US government published <ulink
    url="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2008/m08-23.pdf">
    a memo in 2008</ulink>, requesting all <code>.gov</code> sub-domains to
    be DNSSEC signed by December 2009. This explains why <code>.gov</code> is
    the most deployed DNSSEC domain currently, with <ulink
    url="https://fedv6-deployment.antd.nist.gov/cgi-bin/generate-gov"> around
    90% of subdomains signed.</ulink></para></footnote>. So if you operated a
    subdomain in <code>.gov</code>, you must implement DNSSEC in order to be
    compliant.  ICANN also requires that all new top-level domains support
    DNSSEC.</simpara>

    Removed from V1.3 of this guide is is mention of use of DNSSEC as a 
    requirement for PCI DSS (payment by credit card).  This had been
    mentioned as a rumor in earlier versions, but it seems not to have
    come to pass.  The April 2017 version of the PCI DSS "Best Practices"
    document (https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/best_practices_securing_ecommerce.pdf?agreement=true&time=1582228253808)
    makes no mention of DNS or DNSSEC.

    <simpara><emphasis>Enhanced Security</emphasis>: Okay, so the
    big lofty goal of "let's be good" doesn't appeal to you, and you don't have
    any compliance standards to worry about . Here is a more practical reason
    why you should consider DNSSEC: in case of a DNS-based security breach,
    such as cache poisoning or domain hijacking, after all the financial and
    brand damage done to your domain name, you might be placed under scrutiny
    for any preventive measure that could have been put in place. Think of
    this like having your web site only available via HTTP but not
    HTTPS.</simpara>

   <listitem>
    <simpara><emphasis>New Features</emphasis>: DNSSEC brings not only enhanced
    security, but with that new level of security, a whole new suite of
    features. Once DNS can be trusted completely, it becomes possible to
    publish SSL certificates in DNS, or PGP keys for fully automatic
    cross-platform email encryption, or SSH fingerprints... People are still
    coming up with new features, but this all relies on a trust-worthy DNS
    infrastructure. To take a peek at these next generation DNS features, check
