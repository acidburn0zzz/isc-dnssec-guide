Using NSEC3
===========

After reloading the server configuration file, additional DNSSEC
resource records are auto-magically generated. By default, BIND will
generate NSEC records. If you wish to use NSEC3 instead, please follow
the additional steps described in `??? <#recipes-nsec-to-nsec3>`__. To
learn more about the difference between NSEC and NSEC3, please see
`??? <#advanced-discussions-proof-of-nonexistence>`__.
