 <title>Query Path</title>
 <para>The first step to your DNS or DNSSEC troubleshooting should be to
 determine the query path. This is not a DNSSEC-specific troubleshooting
 technique. Whenever you are working with a DNS-related issue, it is
 always a good idea to determine the exact query path to identify the
 origin of the problem.</para>

 <para>End clients, such as laptop computers or mobile phones, are
 configured to talk to a recursive name server, and the recursive name
 server may in turn forward on to more recursive name servers, before
 arriving at the authoritative name server. The giveaway is the presence
 of the Authoritative Answer (<code>aa</code>) flag: when present, we know
 we are talking to the authoritative server; when missing, we are talking
 to a recursive server. The example below shows an answer to a query for
 <code>www.example.com</code> without the Authoritative Answer flag:

 <screen>$ <userinput>dig @10.53.0.3 www.example.com A</userinput>

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.16.0 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; @10.53.0.3 www.example.com a
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:

;; QUESTION SECTION:

 </para>

 <para>Not only do we not see the <code>aa</code> flag, we see the
 presence of an <code>ra</code> flag, which represents Recursion
 Available. This indicates that the server we are talking to (10.53.0.3
 in this example) is a recursive name server. And although we were able to
 get an answer for <code>www.example.com</code>, the answer came from
 somewhere else.</para>

 <para>If we query the authoritative server directly, we get:

 <screen>$ <userinput>dig @10.53.0.2 www.example.com A</userinput>

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.16.0 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; @10.53.0.2 www.example.com a
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 39542
;; flags: qr <userinput>aa</userinput> rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1
;; WARNING: recursion requested but not available
...</screen>
 </para>

 <para>The presence of the <code>aa</code> flag tells us that we are now
 talking to the authoritative name server for <code>www.example.com</code>,
 and this is not a cached answer it obtained from some other name server,
 it served this answer to us right from its own database. In fact, if you
 look closely, the Recursion Available (<code>ra</code>) flag is not present, which means this
 name server is not configured to perform recursion (at least not for this
 client), so it could not have queried another name server to get cached
 results anyway.</para>
