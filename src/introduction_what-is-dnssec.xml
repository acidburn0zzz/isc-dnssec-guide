 <title>What is DNSSEC?</title>
 <para>The Domain Name System (DNS) was designed in a day and age when the
 Internet was a friendly and trusting place. The protocol itself provides
 little protection against malicious or forged answers. DNS Security Extensions
 (DNSSEC) addresses this need, by adding digital signatures into DNS data so
 that each DNS response can be verified for integrity (the answer did not
 change during transit) and authenticity (the data came from the true source,
 not an impostor). In the ideal world when DNSSEC is fully deployed, every
 single DNS answer can be validated and trusted.</para>

 <para>DNSSEC does not provide a secure tunnel; it does not encrypt or hide DNS
 data. It operates independently of an existing Public Key Infrastructure
 (PKI). It does not need SSL certificates or shared secrets. It was designed
 with backwards compatibility in mind, and can be deployed without impacting
 "old" unsecured domain names.</para>

 <para>DNSSEC is deployed on the three major components of the DNS
 infrastructure:</para>

 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <simpara><emphasis>Recursive Server</emphasis>: People use recursive
   servers to lookup external domain names such www.example.com. Operators of
   recursive servers need to enable DNSSEC validation. With validation
   enabled, recursive servers will carry out additional tasks on each DNS
   response they received to ensure its authenticity.</simpara>
  </listitem>
 
  <listitem>
   <simpara><emphasis>Authoritative Server</emphasis>: People who publish DNS
   data on their name servers need to sign that data. This entails creating
   additional resource records, and publishing them to parent domains where
   necessary. With DNSSEC enabled, authoritative servers will respond to
   queries with additional DNS data, such as digital signatures and keys, in
   addition to the standard answers.</simpara>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <simpara><emphasis>Application</emphasis>: This component lives on every
   client machine, from web server to smart phones. This includes resolver
   libraries on different Operating Systems, and applications such as web
   browsers. </simpara>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>

 <para>In this guide, we will focus on the first two components, Recursive
 Server and Authoritative Server, and only lightly touch on the third
 component. We will look at how DNSSEC works, how to configure a validating
 resolver, how to sign DNS zone data, and other operational tasks and
 considerations.</para>
