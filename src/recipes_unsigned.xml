  <title>Reverting to Unsigned Recipe</title>
  
  <para>This recipe describes how to revert from signed zone (DNSSEC) back to
  unsigned (DNS).</para>

  <para>Whether or not the world thinks your zone is signed really comes down
  to the DS records hosted by your parent zone. If there are no DS records, the
  world thinks your zone is not signed. So reverting to unsigned is as easy as
  removing all DS records from the parent zone. </para>

  <para>Below is an example of removing using <ulink
  url="https://www.godaddy.com"> <citetitle>GoDaddy</citetitle></ulink>
  web-based interface to remove all DS records.</para>

  <para>To be on the safe side, you should wait a while before actually
  deleting all signed data from your zone, just in case some validating
  resolvers out there have cached information. After you are certain that all
  cached information have expired (usually this means TTL has passed), you may
  reconfigure your zone. This is the <filename>named.conf</filename> when it is
  signed, with DNSSEC-related configurations in bold:</para>

  <screen>zone "example.com" IN {
    type primary;
    file "db/example.com.db";
    <userinput>key-directory "keys/example.com";</userinput>
    <userinput>inline-signing yes;</userinput>
    <userinput>auto-dnssec maintain;</userinput>
    allow-transfer { any; };
};</screen>

  <para>Remove the 3 lines so your <filename>named.conf</filename> looks like
  this, then use <command>rndc reload</command> to reload the zone:</para>

  <screen>zone "example.com" IN {
    type primary;
    file "db/example.com.db";
    allow-transfer { any; };
};</screen>

  <para>Your zone is now reverted back to the traditional, insecure DNS format.</para>
