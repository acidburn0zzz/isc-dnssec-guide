Who Should Read this Guide?
===========================

This guide is intended to be an introduction to DNSSEC for the DNS
administrator who is comfortable working with the existing BIND and DNS
infrastructure. He or she might be curious about DNSSEC, but has not had
the time to read up about what DNSSEC is (or is not), whether or not
DNSSEC should be a part of her or his environment, and what it means to
deploy it in the field.

This guide provides basic information on how to configure DNSSEC using
BIND 9.16.0 or later. Most of the information (and examples) in this
guide also apply to versions of BIND later than 9.9.0, but some of the
key features described here were only introduced in version 9.16.0.
Readers are assumed to have basic working knowledge of the Domain Name
System (DNS) and related network infrastructure, such as concepts of
TCP/IP. In-depth knowledge of DNS and TCP/IP is not required. The guide
assumes no prior knowledge of DNSSEC or related technology such as
public key cryptography.
