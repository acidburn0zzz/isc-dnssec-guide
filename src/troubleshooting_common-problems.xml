 <!-- ====== Security Lameness ====== -->
 <section id="troubleshooting-security-lameness">
  <title>Security Lameness</title>

  <para>Similar to Lame Delegation in traditional DNS, this refers to the
  symptom when the parent zone holds a set of DS records that point to
  something that does not exist in the child zone. The resulting symptom
  is that the entire child zone may "disappear", being marked as bogus by
  validating resolvers.</para>

  <para>Below is an example attempting to resolve the A record for a test
  domain name www.example.net. From the user's perspective, as
  described in <xref linkend="how-do-i-know-i-have-a-validation-problem"
  />, only SERVFAIL message is returned. On the validating resolver, we
  could see the following messages in syslog:</para>

  <screen>named[126063]: validating example.net/DNSKEY: no valid signature found (DS)
named[126063]: no valid RRSIG resolving 'example.net/DNSKEY/IN': 10.53.0.2#53
named[126063]: broken trust chain resolving 'www.example.net/A/IN': 10.53.0.2#53</screen>

  <para>This gives us a hint that it is a broken trust chain issue. Let's
  take a look at the DS records that are published for the zone.  We have
  highlighted in the key tag ID returned, and shortened the keys for display:</para>

  <screen>$ <userinput>dig @10.53.0.3 example.net. DS</userinput>

</screen>

  <para>Next, we query for the DNSKEY and RRSIG of example.net,
  to see if there's anything wrong. Since we are having trouble
  validating, we flipped on the <command>+cd</command> option to disable
  checking for now to get the results back, even though they do not pass
  the validation tests.
  The <command>+multiline</command> option tells <command>dig</command> to
  print the type, algorithm type, and key id for DNSKEY records.
  Again, key tag ID's are highlighted, and some long strings are
  shortened for display:</para>

  <para>Here is our problem: the parent zone is telling the world that
  <code>example.net</code> is using the key 14956, but the
  authoritative server is saying: no no no, I am using keys 27247 and
  35328. There might be several causes for this mismatch; one possibility
  is that a malicious attacker has compromised one side and change the
  data. The more likely scenario is that the DNS administrator for the
  child zone did not upload the correct key information to the parent
  zone.</para>

 <!-- ====== Incorrect Time ====== -->
 <section id="troubleshooting-incorrect-time">
  <title>Incorrect Time</title>
  <para>In DNSSEC, every record will come with at least one RRSIG, and
  RRSIG contains two timestamps indicating when it starts becoming valid,
  and when it expires. If the validating resolver's current system time
  does not fall within the RRSIG two timestamps, the following error
  messages occur in BIND debug log.</para>

  <para>First, the example below shows the log messages when the RRSIG has
  expired. This could mean the validating resolver system time is
  incorrectly set too far in the future, or the zone administrator has not
  kept up with RRSIG maintenance.</para>

   <screen>validating example.com/DNSKEY: <userinput>verify failed due to bad signature (keyid=19036): RRSIG has expired</userinput></screen>
   
  <para>The logs below show RRSIG validity period has not begun. This
  could mean validation resolver system is incorrectly set too far in the
  past, or the zone administrator has incorrectly generated signatures for
  this domain name.</para>

   <screen>validating example.com/DNSKEY: <userinput>verify failed due to bad signature (keyid=4521): RRSIG validity period has not begun</userinput></screen>
 </section>


 <!-- ====== Invalid Trust Anchors ====== -->
 <section id="troubleshooting-invalid-trust-anchors">
  <title>Invalid Trust Anchors</title>
  <para>As we have seen in the section <xref linkend="trust-anchors"/>,
  whenever a DNSKEY is received by the validating resolver, it is actually
  compared to the list of keys the resolver has explicitly trusted to see if
  further action is needed. If the two keys match, the validating resolver
  stops performing further verification and returns the answer(s) as
  validated.</para>

  <para>But what if the key file on the validating resolver is
  misconfigured or missing? Below we show some examples of log messages
  when things are not working properly.</para>

  <para>First of all, if the key you copied is malformed, BIND will not
  even start up and you will likely find this error message in
  syslog:</para>

   <screen>named[18235]: /etc/bind/named.conf.options:29: <userinput>bad base64 encoding</userinput>
named[18235]: loading configuration: failure</screen>

  <para>If the key is a valid base64 string, but the key algorithm is
  incorrect, or if the wrong key is installed, the first thing you will notice
  is that pretty much all of your DNS lookups result in SERVFAIL, even when you
  are looking up domain names that have not been DNSSEC-enabled. Below shows an
  example of querying a recursive server 10.53.0.3:</para>

   <screen>$ <userinput>dig @10.53.0.3 www.example.com. A</userinput>

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.16.0 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; @10.53.0.3 www.example.org A +dnssec

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:

;; QUESTION SECTION:

</screen>

  <para><command>delv</command> shows similar result:</para>

   <screen>$ <userinput>delv @192.168.1.7 www.example.com. +rtrace</userinput>
;; fetch: www.example.com/A
;; <userinput>resolution failed: SERVFAIL</userinput></screen>

  <para>The next symptom you will see is in the DNSSEC log
  messages:</para>

   <screen>managed-keys-zone: <userinput>DNSKEY set for zone '.' could not be verified with current keys</userinput>
validating ./DNSKEY: starting
validating ./DNSKEY: attempting positive response validation
validating ./DNSKEY: no DNSKEY matching DS
validating ./DNSKEY: no DNSKEY matching DS
validating ./DNSKEY: no valid signature found (DS)</screen>

 </section>



 <!-- ====== Unable to Load Keys ====== -->
 <section id="troubleshooting-unable-to-load-keys">
  <title>Unable to Load Keys</title>
  <para>This is a simple yet common issue. If the keys files were present
  but not readable by <command>named</command>, the syslog messages are
  clear, as shown below:</para>

  <screen>named[32447]: zone example.com/IN (signed): reconfiguring zone keys
named[32447]: dns_dnssec_findmatchingkeys: error reading key file Kexample.com.+008+06817.private: permission denied
named[32447]: dns_dnssec_findmatchingkeys: error reading key file Kexample.com.+008+17694.private: permission denied
named[32447]: zone example.com/IN (signed): next key event: 27-Nov-2014 20:04:36.521</screen>

  <para>However, if no keys are found, the error is not as obvious. Below
  shows the syslog messages after executing <command>rndc
  reload</command>, with the key files missing from the key
  directory:</para>

  <screen>named[32516]: received control channel command 'reload'
named[32516]: loading configuration from '/etc/bind/named.conf'
named[32516]: reading built-in trusted keys from file '/etc/bind/bind.keys'
named[32516]: using default UDP/IPv4 port range: [1024, 65535]
named[32516]: using default UDP/IPv6 port range: [1024, 65535]
named[32516]: sizing zone task pool based on 6 zones
named[32516]: the working directory is not writable
named[32516]: reloading configuration succeeded
named[32516]: reloading zones succeeded
named[32516]: all zones loaded
named[32516]: running
named[32516]: zone example.com/IN (signed): reconfiguring zone keys
named[32516]: zone example.com/IN (signed): next key event: 27-Nov-2014 20:07:09.292</screen>

  <para>This happens to look exactly the same as if the keys were present
  and readable, and <command>named</command> loaded the keys and signed
  the zone. It will even generate the internal (raw) files:</para>

  <screen># cd /etc/bind/db
# ls
example.com.db	example.com.db.jbk  example.com.db.signed</screen>

  <para>If <command>named</command> really loaded the keys and signed the
  zone, you should see the following files:</para>

  <screen># cd /etc/bind/db
# ls
example.com.db	example.com.db.jbk  example.com.db.signed  example.com.db.signed.jnl</screen>

  <para>So, unless you see the <code>*.signed.jnl</code> file, your zone
  has not been signed.</para>
