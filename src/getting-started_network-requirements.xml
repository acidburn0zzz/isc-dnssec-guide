 <para>From a network perspective, DNS and DNSSEC packets are very similar,
 DNSSEC packets are just bigger, which means DNS is more likely to use TCP. You
 should test for the following two items, to make sure your network is ready
 for DNSSEC:

  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
    <simpara><emphasis>DNS over TCP</emphasis>: Verify network connectivity
    over TCP port 53, this may mean updating firewall policies or Access
    Control List (ACL) on routers. See <xref linkend="dns-uses-tcp"/> more
    details.</simpara>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <simpara><emphasis>Large UDP packets</emphasis>: Some network equipment such as
    firewalls may make assumptions about the size of DNS UDP packets and incorrectly
    reject DNS traffic that appears "too big". You should verify that the
    responses your nameserver generates are being seen by the rest
    of the world.  See <xref linkend="whats-edns0-all-about"/> for
    more details.</simpara>
