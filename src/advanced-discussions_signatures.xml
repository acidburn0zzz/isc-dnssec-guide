 <title>Signature Validity Periods and Zone Re-Signing Intervals</title>
 <para>In <xref linkend="how-are-answers-verified"/>, we saw that record
 signatures have a validity period, outside which they are not valid.
 This means that at some point, a signature will no longer be valid and
 a query for the associated record will fail DNSSEC validation.  But
 how long should a signature be valid for?</para>

 <para>The selection of maximum validity period is determined by the
 impact of a replay attack.  If this is low, the period can be long; if
 this is high, the period should be shorter.  There is no right value,
 but periods of between a few days to a month seem to be common. The
 default policy sets a signature lifetime of 14 days.</para>

 <para>Deciding the minimum period is probably an easier question to
 answer.  Should something fail (e.g. a hidden master distributing to
 slave servers that actually answer queries), how long will it be
 before the failure is noticed, and how long before it is fixed?  If
 you are a large 24x7 operation with operators always on site, the
 answer might be less  than an hour.  On the other hand in smaller
 companies, if the failure occurs just after everyone has gone home for
 a long weekend, the answer might be several days.  </para>

 <para>There is no right answer to these questions - the answer depends
 on your circumstances.  At the time of writing, the default policy
 used by BIND sets the signature validity period to 14 days.</para>

 <para>Since the signatures expire, to keep the zone valid, the
 signatures must be periodically refreshed, in other words, the zone
 must be periodically re-signed.  The frequency of the re-signing
 depends on a number of considerations.  For example, signing puts a
 load on your server, so if the server is very highly loaded, a lower
 frequency is better.  Another consideration is the signature lifetime.
 Obviously the intervals between signings must not be longer that the
 signature validity period.  But if you have set a signature lifetime
 close to the minimum (see above), the signing interval must be much
 shorter (what would happen if the system fails just before the zone is
 re-signed?).</para>

 <para>Again, there is no right answer, it depends on your
 circumstances.  The default policy sets the signature refresh interval
 to 5 days.</para>
