    <abstract>
      <para>This is version &__VERSION__; of the DNSSEC deployment guide for
      BIND 9.</para>

      <para>BIND 9 is open source software that implements the Domain Name System
      (DNS) protocols for the Internet. It is a reference implementation of
      those protocols, but it is also production-grade software, suitable for
      use in high-volume and high-reliability applications.</para>

      <para>Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) extends standard
      DNS to provide a measure of security; it proves that the data comes from
      the official source and has not been modified in transit.</para>

      <para>ISC BIND 9 supports the full set of DNSSEC standards.</para>
