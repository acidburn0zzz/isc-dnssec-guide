 <title>Easy Start Guide for Recursive Servers</title>
 <para>This section provides the minimum amount of information to setup a
 working DNSSEC-aware recursive server, also known as a validating resolver. A
 validating resolver performs validation for each remote response received,
 following the chain of trust to verify the answers it receives are legitimate
 through the use of public key cryptography and hashing functions.</para>

 <para>Once DNSSEC validation is enabled, any DNS response that does not pass
 the validation checks will result in the domain name not getting resolved
 (often a SERVFAIL status seen by the client).  What this means for the DNS
 administrator is, if there is a DNSSEC configuration issue (sometimes outside
 of the administrator's control), a specific name, or sometimes entire domains,
 may "disappear" from DNS, in that it becomes unreachable through that
 resolver. For the end user, the issue may manifest itself as name resolution
 being slow or failing altogether, some parts of a URL not loading, or the web
 browser displaying some error message indicating that the page cannot be
 displayed at all.</para>

 <para>For example, if root name servers were misconfigured with the wrong
 information about <code>.org</code>, it could cause all validation for
 <code>.org</code> domains to fail. To the end users, it would appear that no
 one could get to any <code>.org</code> web sites.</para>

 <para>You may not need to reconfigure your name server at all, since recent
 versions of BIND packages and distributions have been shipped with DNSSEC
 validation enabled by default. Before making any configuration changes, check
 whether or not you already have DNSSEC validation by following steps described
 in <xref linkend="how-to-test-recursive-server"/>.</para>

 <para>In earlier versions of BIND including, at the time of writing (March 2020),
 the current extended support version (9.11), DNSSEC validation has to be
 explicitly enabled.  To do this, you only need to add one line to the
 <code>options</code> section of your configuration file:

 <screen>options {
    ...
    <userinput>dnssec-validation auto;</userinput>
    ...
};</screen></para>

 <para>Restart <command>named</command> or use <command>rndc reconfig</command>,
 and your recursive server is now happily validating each DNS response. If this
 does not work for you, and you have already verified DNSSEC support as
 described in <xref linkend="dnssec-support-in-bind"/>, you most likely have
 some other network-related configurations that need to be adjusted. Take a
 look at <xref linkend="network-requirements"/> to make sure your network is
 ready for DNSSEC.</para>
