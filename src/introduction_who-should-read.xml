 <title>Who Should Read this Guide?</title>
 <para>This guide is intended to be an introduction to DNSSEC for the DNS
 administrator who is comfortable working with the existing BIND and DNS
 infrastructure. He or she might be curious about DNSSEC, but has not had the
 time to read up about what DNSSEC is (or is not), whether or not DNSSEC should
 be a part of her or his environment, and what it means to deploy it in the
 field.</para>

 <para>This guide provides basic information on how to configure DNSSEC using
 BIND 9. Readers are assumed to have basic working knowledge of the Domain Name
 System (DNS) and related network infrastructure, such as concepts of TCP/IP.
 In-depth knowledge of DNS and TCP/IP is not required. The guide assumes no
 prior knowledge of DNSSEC or related technology such as public key
 cryptography.</para>
