 <title>Working with Parent Zone</title>
 <para>As we mentioned in <xref
 linkend="signing-easy-start-upload-to-parent-zone" />, the format of the
 information you upload to your parent zone is dictated by your parent zone
 administrator, and the three main formats are:

  <orderedlist>
   <listitem><simpara>DS Record Format</simpara></listitem>
   <listitem><simpara>DNSKEY Format</simpara></listitem>
   <listitem><simpara>Trusted Key Format</simpara></listitem>
  </orderedlist>
 </para>

 <para>ccTLDs typically maintain their own lists of registrars and
 should have a list of which of those support DNSSEC.  ICANN maintains
 a list of accredited registrars who support DNSSEC for gTLDs:
 <simpara><ulink

 </simpara></para>

 <para>Next, we will take a look at how to get each of the three
 formats from your existing data.</para>


 <!-- === DS Record Format === -->
 <section id="parent-ds-record-format">
  <title>DS Record Format</title>

  <para>Below is an example of generating DS record formats from the KSK we
  created earlier (<filename>Kexample.com.+008+28267.key</filename>) using two
  different secure hashing algorithms (SHA-1 and SHA-256, respectively):</para>

  <screen># <userinput>cd /etc/bind/keys/example.com</userinput>
# <userinput>dnssec-dsfromkey -a SHA-1 Kexample.com.+008+06817.key</userinput>
example.com. IN DS 6817 8 1 59194A835ACD78D25D538D5F35CA043A8F3F4446
# <userinput>dnssec-dsfromkey -a SHA-256 Kexample.com.+008+06817.key</userinput>
example.com. IN DS 6817 8 2 2A5F1DF55D5E64CBD7BCFE1EFA6E9586AF335FA56A2473296E975B89AFD31E11</screen>

  <para>Some registrars many ask you to manually specify the types of algorithm
  and digest used. In the first example, 8 represents the algorithm used, and 1
  represents the digest type (SHA-1); in the second example, 8 is the
  algorithm, and 2 is the digest type (SHA-256). The key tag or key ID is
  28267.</para>

  <para>Alternatively, you could generate it from the DNSKEY records like
  this:</para>

  <screen>$ <userinput>dig @192.168.1.13 example.com. DNSKEY | dnssec-dsfromkey -f - example.com</userinput>
example.com. IN DS 6817 8 1 59194A835ACD78D25D538D5F35CA043A8F3F4446
example.com. IN DS 6817 8 2 2A5F1DF55D5E64CBD7BCFE1EFA6E9586AF335FA56A2473296E975B89AFD31E11</screen>

 </section>


 <!-- === DNSKEY Format === -->
 <section id="parent-dnskey-format">
  <title>DNSKEY Format</title>

  <para>Below is an example of a different key ID (16027) using DNSKEY format
  (actual key shortened for display):</para>

  <screen>example.com. 172800 IN DNSKEY 257 3 8 (AwEAAbGOPf...AX2QHMY8=) ; key id = 16027</screen>
  
  <para>The key itself is easy to find (it's kind of hard to miss that big long
  base64 string) in the file. Remember, we want the KSK, so look for the presence
  of 257.</para>

  <screen># <userinput>cd /etc/bind/keys/example.com</userinput>
# <userinput>cat Kexample.com.+008+06817.key</userinput>
; This is a key-signing key, keyid <userinput>6817</userinput>, for example.com.
; Created: 20141120094612 (Thu Nov 20 17:46:12 2014)
; Publish: 20141120094612 (Thu Nov 20 17:46:12 2014)
; Activate: 20141120094612 (Thu Nov 20 17:46:12 2014)
example.com. IN DNSKEY <userinput>257</userinput> 3 8 AwEAAcWDps...lM3NRn/G/R</screen>

  <para>Some registrars may ask you to manually specify the type of algorithm
  used and the key tag number. In our example above, the chosen algorithm is 8,
  and the key ID is 6817.</para>

 </section>


 <!-- === Trusted Key Format === -->
 <section id="parent-trusted-key-format">
  <title>Trusted Key Format</title>
  <para>This format is very similar to the DNSKEY format, the differences are
  mostly cosmetic. Below is an example of <varname>trusted-keys</varname>
  format (again, actual key shortened for display):</para>

  <screen>"example.com." 257 3 8 "AwEAAbGOPf...9AX2QHMY8=";</screen>

 </section>


 <!-- === What if My Parent Zone Doesn't Support DNSSEC? === -->
 <!--
 <section id="parent-no-dnssec-support">
  <title>What if My Parent Zone Doesn't Support DNSSEC?</title>
  <para>Without a parent zone to vouch for you, none of your new shiny DNSSEC
  records will be of much use when it comes to validation. Your
  zone will still be resolvable without cooperation from your parent
  zone, though.</para>

  <para>But not all hope is lost. Assuming you want everyone on the Internet to
  be able to validate your DNS data, you should do both of the following:
  </para>

  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
    <simpara>Contact your domain registrar and/or registries and ask for DNSSEC support.</simpara>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <simpara>Look into using <xref linkend="dlv"><citetitle>DLV</citetitle></xref>, but be aware that this is only an interim solution.</simpara>
   </listitem>
  </orderedlist>

  <para>The long term solution is still to have your parent zone work with you.
  If your registrar does not support DNSSEC, maybe it's time to switch to one
  that does.</para>
