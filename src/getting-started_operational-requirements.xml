  <para>Before starting your DNSSEC deployment, check with your parent zone
  administrators to make sure they support DNSSEC. This may or may not be the
  same entity as your registrar. As you will see later in <xref
  linkend="working-with-parent-zone" />, a crucial step in DNSSEC deployment is
  to establish the parent-child trust relationship. If your parent zone does not
  support DNSSEC yet, contact them to voice your concern.</para>

  <para>ICANN maintains a list of registrars who support DNSSEC:

<!-- TODO:  make a clearer distinction between support in your
parent zone, and support from your registrar - perhaps a separate
subsection for each one.  -->

  <title>Security Requirements</title>
  <para>Some organizations may be subject to stricter security requirements
  than others. Check to see if your organization requires stronger
  cryptographic keys be generated and stored, or how often keys need to be
  rotated. The examples presented in this document are not intended for high
  value zones. We cover some of these security considerations in <xref
  linkend="dnssec-advanced-discussions" />.</para>
