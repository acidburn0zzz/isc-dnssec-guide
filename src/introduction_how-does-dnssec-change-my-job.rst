How does DNSSEC Change My Job as a DNS Administrator?
=====================================================

With this protocol extension, some of the things you are used to in DNS
will change. As the DNS administrator, you will have new maintenance
tasks to perform on a regular basis (as described in
`??? <#signing-maintenance-tasks>`__); when there's a DNS resolution
problem, you have new troubleshooting techniques and tools to use (as
described in `??? <#dnssec-troubleshooting>`__). BIND tries its best to
make these things as transparent and seamless as possible. In this
guide, we try to use the configuration examples that result in the least
amount of work for DNS administrators.
