 <title>Who May Not Want to Read this Guide?</title>

 <para>If you are already operating a DNSSEC-signed zone, you may not learn
 much from the first half of the document, and you may want to start with <xref
 linkend="dnssec-advanced-discussions" />. If you want to
 learn about details of the protocol extension, such as data fields and flags,
 or the new record types, this document can help you get started but it
 won't include all the technical details. If you are experienced in DNSSEC, you
 may find some of the concepts in this document to be overly simplified for
 your taste, and some details may be purposely omitted at times for
 illustration. If you administer a large or complex BIND environment, this
 guide may not provide enough information for you, as it is intended to provide
 the most basic, generic working examples. If you are a TLD operator, or
 administer zones under signed TLDs, this guide can
 help you get started, but does not provide enough details to serve all of your
 needs.  If your DNS environment uses DNS products other than (or in addition to)
 BIND, this document may provide some background or overlapping information, but you
 should check each product's vendor documentation for specifics. Finally, deploying
 DNSSEC on internal or private networks is not covered in this document, with the
 exception of a brief discussion in <xref linkend="dnssec-on-private-networks" />.</para>
